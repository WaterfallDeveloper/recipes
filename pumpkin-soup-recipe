Pumpkin soup

Ingredients:
4 tbsp olive oil
2 onions, finely chopped
1kg pumpkins or squash (try kabocha), peeled, deseeded and chopped into chunks
700ml vegetable stock or chicken stock
142ml pot double cream
4 slices wholemeal seeded bread
handful pumpkin seed from a packet

Method


1. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan, then gently cook 2 finely chopped
onions for 5 mins, until soft but not coloured. Add 1kg peeled, deseeded and 
chopped pumpkin or squash to the pan, then carry on cooking for 8-10 mins,
stirring occasionally until it starts to soften and turn golden.

2. Pour 700ml vegetable stock into the pan, then season with salt and pepper.
Bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 mins until the squash is very soft. Pour
the 142ml pot of double cream into the pan, bring back to the boil, then pureÃÅe
with a hand blender. For an extra-velvety consistency you can now push the soup
through a fine sieve into another pan. The soup can now be frozen for up to 2
months.

3. While the soup is cooking, slice the crusts from 4 slices of wholemeal seed
bread, then cut the bread into small croutons. Heat the remaining 2 tbsp olive
oil in a frying pan, then fry the bread until it starts to become crisp. Add a
handful of pumpkin seeds to the pan, then cook for a few mins more until they
are toasted. These can be made a day ahead and stored in an airtight container.
Reheat the soup if needed, taste for seasoning, then serve scattered with 
croutons and seeds and drizzled with more olive oil, if you want.
